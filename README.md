# Windows Logon service

This service is able to run any application on user login screen. I don't remember how it works â€” I spend several weeks to collect all solutions from internet into one working project. PR are welcome!

# How to use
1. Find in code LogonUI string and replace to your application
2. Build solution
3. Install service

# Tested in next Operating systems:
Windows XP SP3, 7, 8.1, 10

TODO:
1. Write documentation (just run in console)
2. Write documentation for code
3. Move running aplication path to settings for standalone use
4. Make code more logical (?)
5. Publish in repository as library (?)
